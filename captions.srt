1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,880
if a 60% free throw shooter takes 10

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,860
shots what is the probability that it

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,719
makes exactly seven of them

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,160
to answer questions like that we can use

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,680
this formula for the binomial

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,600
distribution and this doesn't just apply

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,520
to free throws it applies whenever

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,840
there's a repeating process where you

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,880
could put the outcomes into two

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,100
categories that's where the buy and

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,960
binomial comes from and that kind of

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,880
situation is pretty common considering

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,579
it encompasses all yes or no questions

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,200
the formula looks a bit scary but by the

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,300
end of this video we'll make sense of it

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:41,290
and hopefully it's pretty along the way

17
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,290
[Music]

18
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,899
okay we're going to start with one blob

19
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,820
it's programmed to make it 60 of the

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,280
time so what's the probability that it

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,260
would make one out of one this question

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,940
feels a little bit silly we don't need

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,980
any fancy formulas to know that the

24
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,379
answer is sixty percent but it's a

25
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,059
starting point to build on another silly

26
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,640
starting question is what's the

27
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,260
probability it makes zero of one it's

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,020
the other forty percent of the time

29
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,640
sixty percent is the same as three out

30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,560
of five so we can visualize the

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,240
probabilities by looking at five blobs

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,979
and having three of them make it and two

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,080
of them Miss

34
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,240
okay now what if the blobs take two

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,100
shots each it'll be helpful to have more

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,840
blobs to look at here so let's make this

37
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,820
into a square of blobs and have the new

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,920
blobs also take their first shot again

39
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,659
with three out of five of them making it

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,340
and then they can all take a second shot

41
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,759
which means we now have to ask about

42
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,860
making zero one or two of two shots you

43
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,479
might notice this isn't exactly random

44
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,460
but for the moment we're just focusing

45
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,920
on making a clean diagram

46
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,540
four of the 25 blobs were unlucky enough

47
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,240
to miss both the first and the second

48
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,920
shot from this we can say that a sixty

49
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,680
percent free throw shooter has a 16

50
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,240
probability of missing both shots and

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,920
this is the same number we would have

52
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,619
gotten by multiplying the probabilities

53
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,420
of the individual shot outcomes the

54
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,360
probability of missing the first shot is

55
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,460
40 then 40 percent of those forty

56
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,140
percent also missed the second shot and

57
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,840
forty percent of forty percent comes out

58
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,580
to sixteen percent next for the blobs

59
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,920
that made one shot we have two groups

60
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,500
one group of six made the first and

61
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,440
missed the second shot and six out of 25

62
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,060
is 24 again we can multiply the

63
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,580
individual probabilities to check that

64
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,260
they come out the same and indeed sixty

65
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,180
percent for the make times forty percent

66
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,580
for the Miss comes out to twenty four

67
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,620
percent the second group is pretty much

68
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,300
the same except the make and the Miss

69
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,640
come in the opposite order

70
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,580
and adding these together we get a 48

71
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,379
probability for making one or two shots

72
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,300
and for the ones that made both shots

73
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,519
there's again just one group and we can

74
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,700
fill in the numbers in the same way and

75
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,440
all these probabilities add up to 100

76
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,420
which is a great sign

77
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,640
we're gonna add a third shot in a moment

78
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,160
here but it might already be possible to

79
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,480
guess at the pattern so try pausing and

80
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,940
see if you can predict what it's going

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,280
to look like after three shots

82
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,200
okay for the third shot it'll be useful

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,540
to have even more blobs to look at so

84
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,040
let's make this a 3D grid and have the

85
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,040
new blobs take their first two shots

86
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,780
[Music]

87
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,180
with three shots the top three layers

88
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,860
made it and the bottom two layers missed

89
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,480
it's a little bit difficult to see

90
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,159
what's going on inside this Cube so

91
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,800
let's pull it apart into sections and

92
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,659
organize it by outcome okay so again

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,780
there's only one way to miss all of the

94
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:29,220
shots eight of the 125 blobs ended up in

95
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,319
this category which gives us a

96
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,599
probability of 6.4 percent for that

97
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,220
outcome and again we could get this same

98
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,379
number by multiplying the probabilities

99
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,720
of the individual misses

100
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:41,940
next for one make out of three shots

101
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,519
there are three ways to get it the first

102
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,700
way in this list is Miss Miss then make

103
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,420
12 of the 125 blobs had this outcome

104
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,560
which gives us a 9.6 probability

105
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,819
multiplying the individual probabilities

106
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,739
looks like this

107
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:57,060
the thing to notice here is that all

108
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,040
three of these groups have the same

109
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,319
number of blobs in them the probability

110
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,000
is the same for each of them we don't

111
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,799
care about the order of makes and misses

112
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,959
we just care about how many there are

113
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,819
and Order also doesn't matter for

114
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,580
multiplication so each of these comes

115
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,260
out to the same 9.6 percent which means

116
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,299
we don't have to go through all the

117
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,919
different ways of making one of three we

118
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,780
can just calculate the probability for

119
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:20,820
one of them then multiply that result by

120
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,040
3 to get the overall probability of

121
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,840
making one out of three shots

122
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,880
and this idea will come in handy for

123
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,740
looking at two out of three just like

124
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,660
before there are three groups and they

125
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,000
each have the same probability which is

126
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,520
14.4 percent each for an overall

127
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,620
probability of 43.2 percent to make two

128
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,660
out of three and four three out of three

129
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,120
there's just one way with a probability

130
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,400
of 21.6 percent

131
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,199
so we have this pattern of counting the

132
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,639
number of specific ways to make a

133
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,740
certain number of shots and then

134
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,840
multiplying that by the probability for

135
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,240
each of those specific ways which again

136
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,520
are always the same and that's exactly

137
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,380
what this formula does this bit here

138
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,540
stands for the number of ways to get K

139
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,300
makes out of n total shots it's called

140
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,680
the binomial coefficient in this example

141
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,020
we just went through the binomial

142
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,699
coefficient is one three three or one

143
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,740
depending how many makes we're asking

144
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,419
about we don't yet have a great way of

145
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,220
finding it for other numbers of attempts

146
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:16,380
and makes so most of the rest of this

147
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,699
video is going to focus on that and the

148
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,620
second part is multiplying the

149
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,500
probabilities of the individual shots

150
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:26,039
this little p is the probability of a

151
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,139
success so 60 in this case and one minus

152
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:31,320
the little p is the probability of a

153
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:33,000
failure so forty percent and if we write

154
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,620
these calculations so far using

155
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,440
exponents you can start to see how they

156
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:40,199
have the same shape as the formula so

157
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,940
this formula has a lot of pieces and a

158
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,259
lot of letters so depending how much

159
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,820
practice you've had with algebra

160
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,979
recently it might feel a bit

161
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,199
overwhelming if so I can guarantee

162
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,060
you're not alone and it might be a good

163
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,620
exercise to pause take out a piece of

164
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,900
paper and plug the numbers into the

165
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,820
formula for each case yourself

166
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,860
now all the math nerds out there are

167
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,419
going to yell at me with good reason if

168
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,400
I don't mention that this formula only

169
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:04,680
makes sense if the shots are independent

170
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,080
of each other which might not be true

171
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,460
for example missing the first shot might

172
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,900
make you nervous changing the

173
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,900
probability of making the next shot

174
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,100
making things way more complicated for

175
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,600
the rest of this video though we're

176
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,460
going to assume that the interactions

177
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,740
between shots are minor enough that we

178
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,660
can ignore them and these blobs don't

179
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,120
even have the memory of a goldfish so

180
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,800
every shot is a fresh start that might

181
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,660
sound lazy but even if you care about

182
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,699
making the most accurate model possible

183
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,800
it's usually good to start with a

184
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,139
simpler model then test it to see how it

185
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,160
performs then add complexity if you need

186
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,840
to

187
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,580
alright so now we have the overall

188
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,900
structure of the formula figured out but

189
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,819
we're not quite ready to answer that

190
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,960
original question about making seven of

191
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,000
ten shots

192
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,800
we can plug in the numbers but it's not

193
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,240
clear just yet how we count how many

194
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,520
different ways there are to arrange

195
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,380
seven makes and three misses

196
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,240
okay let's start fresh forgetting about

197
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,979
the probabilities and just focus on

198
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,900
Counting the ways each number of shots

199
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:00,300
could be made which again is called the

200
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,039
binomial coefficient starting with a

201
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,560
blob that hasn't taken any shots yet

202
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:06,780
there's only one possibility where it's

203
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,400
made zero shots when the blob takes a

204
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,740
shot there are two possible branches

205
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,080
reality can take one where the shot goes

206
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,880
in and one where the shot misses and

207
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,560
this is true every time we add a shot

208
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,000
for the second shot these two

209
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,400
possibilities split into four

210
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,500
possibilities one possible way of

211
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,479
missing both shots two possible ways of

212
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,759
making one of the two and one way of

213
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,280
making both so just like before we have

214
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,319
this one two one pattern after two shots

215
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,120
the neat thing about this table is that

216
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,280
both ways to make one out of two shots

217
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,900
are tracked together the tree of blobs

218
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,699
over on the right tracks every single

219
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,259
possible order of makes and misses but

220
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,880
the number of blobs we have to draw is

221
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,919
going to double every time we add a shot

222
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,780
since we only care about the total

223
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,340
number of makes lumping them together in

224
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,720
a table is good enough and it makes the

225
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,880
tracking a lot easier

226
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,039
and adding a third shot we get the same

227
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,259
pattern we found before with one three

228
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,419
three and one ways to get each total of

229
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,460
successes but now it's going to be a lot

230
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,900
easier to add a fourth shot we can just

231
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,460
continue the pattern of pushing the

232
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,680
numbers down the table and combining

233
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,360
them so for four shots it looks like

234
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,759
there's still just one way to miss them

235
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,039
all four ways to make one six ways to

236
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,380
make two four ways to make three and one

237
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,240
way to make all four and we can just

238
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,460
continue this pattern to find any number

239
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,319
we need

240
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,940
so now we could use the binomial

241
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,440
distribution formula to answer this

242
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,020
question from the very beginning of the

243
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,400
video what is the probability a sixty

244
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,500
percent free throw shooter will make

245
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,199
seven of ten we can look at this table

246
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,880
to see that there are 120 ways to make 7

247
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,740
out of 10 shots

248
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,260
and the probability for each of those

249
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,080
ways happening is 0.6 to the seventh

250
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,580
power for the seven makes times 0.4 to

251
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,740
the third power for the three misses

252
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,959
that comes out to a pretty small number

253
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,240
but if you combine all 120 different

254
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:52,320
ways to make seven they add up to about

255
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,300
21.5 percent so that's our answer

256
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,160
this pattern is known as Pascal's

257
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,320
triangle it's usually written like this

258
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,360
the numbers on the outside of each row

259
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,100
are one and each number in the middle is

260
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,260
found by adding the two numbers above it

261
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,839
so we now have a way to get this

262
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,060
binomial coefficient for any numbers but

263
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,980
it's still a lot of work especially if

264
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,260
the numbers are big so it would be nice

265
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,480
if there were a faster way to do it

266
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,940
the good news is there's a formula for

267
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,680
the binomial coefficient the bad news is

268
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,480
it looks like this

269
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,339
those exclamation points are called

270
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,080
factorials if you haven't seen them

271
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,959
before I think it's easiest to explain

272
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,839
them with examples one factorial is one

273
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:33,180
two factorial is two times one three

274
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,580
factorial is three times two times one

275
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,399
and four factorial is say it with me

276
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,080
four times three times two times one you

277
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,660
multiply the number by one less than

278
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,760
itself then by two less and so on all

279
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,620
the way down to one so to say this

280
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,779
formula in words we take the factorial

281
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,700
of the total number of shots and then we

282
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:52,860
divide by the factorial of the number of

283
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,019
makes and we also divide by the

284
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,600
factorial of the number of Misses which

285
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:59,640
reminds me zero factorial is defined as

286
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,620
one that can feel a bit weird at first

287
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,940
so I'll link to some videos about it but

288
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,860
I figured I should mention it because

289
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,899
it's required for this formula to work

290
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,240
when we have 0 makes or zero misses

291
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,980
anyway with this formula we can find the

292
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,140
binomial coefficient without having to

293
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,300
look at Pascal's triangle but it's

294
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,459
probably not super clear yet why this

295
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,019
formula Works to make sense of it let's

296
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:21,060
zoom out a bit and think about counting

297
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,459
Arrangements in General we'll start out

298
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,880
with one object how many ways are there

299
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:28,800
to arrange this one object there's just

300
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,600
one I guess there it is

301
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,279
if we had a second object we can do it

302
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,339
in one of two weights we can put it to

303
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:37,080
the left or to the right so by adding a

304
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,360
second object we multiply the number of

305
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,339
possible Arrangements by two

306
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,440
to add a third object we can take the

307
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,880
previous orderings one at a time and add

308
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,120
the new objects to three different

309
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,920
places left middle or right so by adding

310
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,019
a third object we multiply the number of

311
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,640
possible Arrangements by three you might

312
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,740
be starting to see a pattern but let's

313
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,959
do one more if we add a fourth object

314
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,820
there are four places we can put it so

315
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:01,560
by adding a fourth object we multiply

316
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,200
the number of possible Arrangements by

317
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,579
four the number of possible Arrangements

318
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,320
is already starting to get out of hand

319
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:09,000
but thankfully we can see the pattern

320
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,800
now and don't have to list them all out

321
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,720
anymore if you want to arrange any

322
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,700
unique objects there are n factorial

323
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,260
ways to do it and that's where the N

324
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,420
factorial in the numerator of this

325
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,640
formula comes from now is a good time to

326
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,500
pause and make sure that n factorial in

327
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,360
the numerator make sense if it doesn't

328
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,220
the part that comes next certainly won't

329
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,720
either all that's left is to figure out

330
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,459
the factorials in the bottom of the

331
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,959
formula these let us account for

332
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:32,640
situations where the objects aren't

333
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,440
unique but instead fall into two

334
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,420
different categories like makes and

335
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,980
misses remember that's what binomial

336
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,899
means we're going to look at some

337
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,760
examples to help this make sense but the

338
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,019
quick explanation is that since we don't

339
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,940
care about the order of identical

340
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,040
objects n factorial is counting

341
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,540
orderings we don't care about so we have

342
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,000
to divide by the number of ways to

343
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,800
arrange the objects in each category so

344
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,720
for example let's focus on the situation

345
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,399
with three blobs and we'll take the

346
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,140
perspective that we only care about

347
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,800
whether the blobs are wearing hats or

348
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,480
not

349
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,360
two of the three blobs are wearing hats

350
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,339
so if we just care about hat or no half

351
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,959
of the orderings are the same half of

352
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:09,120
them have the wizard hat first and half

353
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,560
of them have the propeller hat first so

354
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,899
we should divide by the two ways of

355
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,279
ordering the two hats or to write it in

356
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,200
a way that looks like the binomial

357
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,060
coefficient formula we could divide by

358
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,579
the two factorial ways to order the two

359
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,860
hats and also the one factorial ways to

360
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:24,779
order the one blob with no hat this

361
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,700
example has pretty small numbers so the

362
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:28,140
pattern might not be super clear yet so

363
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,959
let's run through some examples with

364
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,060
four blobs we have four factorial total

365
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,500
ways to arrange the blobs but if we're

366
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,360
just worried about the hats we'll again

367
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,339
divide by the two factorial ways to

368
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,959
order the hats but will also divide by

369
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,180
the two factorial ways to order the

370
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:45,000
non-hats and this gets us to six

371
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:47,279
orderings of hats and non-hats okay

372
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,680
let's do one more example this time with

373
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,240
three of the four blobs wearing hats we

374
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,220
still have four factorial ways to

375
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,139
arrange the blobs and focusing on the

376
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,000
hat or not hat orderings we can divide

377
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:59,639
by the three factorial ways to arrange

378
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,139
the hats which gets us to four for these

379
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,760
examples with small numbers it wouldn't

380
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:04,740
be too hard to just list out all the

381
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,360
possibilities and count them but this

382
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,399
pattern where we take the factorial of

383
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,959
the total number of objects then divide

384
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,000
by the factorials of the numbers in each

385
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,560
group are focusing on lets us find the

386
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,779
binomial coefficient for any numbers

387
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,180
imagine trying to do this by hand for

388
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:19,800
the 7 out of 10 example this is just a

389
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,480
small taste of the area of math that

390
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,800
deals with counting how to group or

391
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,720
arrange things which is called

392
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,100
combinatorics so that's something you

393
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,019
could look up if you're interested in

394
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,940
hearing more about this kind of thing

395
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,500
so we've done a bunch of theorizing

396
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,120
about how this formula should be able to

397
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,500
calculate the probabilities of a free

398
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,720
throw shooter hitting a certain number

399
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,279
of shots before we're satisfied with it

400
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,019
though we should check that it works by

401
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,540
testing it against some randomized

402
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:44,399
results Let's test it with ten thousand

403
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,860
blobs since that's a number that only

404
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,660
almost breaks my computer

[Music]

411
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,399
it's pretty close it's not exact but we

412
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,560
shouldn't expect it to be exact even

413
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,540
with 10 000 blobs and we did get this

414
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,459
one blob that didn't make a single shot

415
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,959
poor little buddy let's let it keep

416
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,579
trying while we summarize what we've

417
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:43,920
learned about this formula for

418
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:46,260
repeatable independent events whose

419
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,360
results can be categorized as a yes or a

420
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,279
no this formula gives the probability

421
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,139
that you get a certain number of yeses

422
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:54,240
or no's in a certain number of Trials

423
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:56,940
and of course you need to know the

424
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,160
probability of an individual yes or no

425
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,720
